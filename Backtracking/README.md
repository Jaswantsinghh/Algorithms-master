# What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is an improvement of the brute force approach. It systematically searches for a
solution to a problem among all available options. In backtracking, we start with one possible
option out of many available options and try to solve the problem if we are able to solve the
problem with the selected move then we will print the solution else we will backtrack and select
some other option and try to solve it. If none if the options work out we will claim that there is no solution for the problem. It is a type of recursion.
